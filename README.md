# A3-preset-analyzer
Compares installed mods with mods used in saved presets and outputs IDs of unused mods in the console and in a CSV file
The Mod-IDs can be used to find the Steam Workshop site via the link

Sadly, an automatic search in the Steam Workshop is way to much effort for this small project.
